# MarsRoverApiApplication

Hello there! Welcome to my Mars Rover Application! The purpose here is to challenge myself by creating a fun application that focuses on improving my backend skills.

<br>

To access and utilize the application, you'll need to set up a MySQL database and input the required information into the "application.properties" file in the code.

The reason why it needs a database, is because it has a checkBoxe called "remember preferences" that allow you literally remember your preferences.
The reason for requiring a database is due to the presence of a checkbox "remember preferences," which permits the app to store and reuse your selected preferences.

Now, you might wonder, what preferences are we talking about? Well, the API includes three types of rovers: "Curiosity," "Opportunity," and "Spirit," and each rover type offers different sets of photos.

However, each rover has a selection of available cameras, and you won't be able to choose a camera that is not accessible, so there's no need for you to worry about that.
