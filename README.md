# MarsRoverApiApplication

Hello there, welcome to my Mars Rover Application! The purpose in here is to challange myself on doing a fun application focusing on improving my backend.
<br>
To see and use the application, in the code, you need to create a database in mySQL and fill in the application.properties with the necessary data.

The reason why it needs a database, is because it has a checkBoxe called "remember preferences" that allow you literally remember your preferences.

Now, what preferences? do you ask. Well, the api came with 3 types of rovers: "Curiosity", "Opportunity" and "Spirit", and each type of rover have diferent photos.
